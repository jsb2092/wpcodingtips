I created this page because I like C# and am I fan of Windows Phones.  During the day, I teach at a local University.  One of my favorite classes to teach is an advanced C# class.  It is in this class that I challenge students to come up with new and inovative solutions to problems.  What occurred to me while doing this is that I get the same questions over and over again, especially with the new APIs.  To that end, I am putting this page together to answer common questions that people have about the new API, give tips and tricks about how to do some cool things and give insight about how do things that Microsoft expects you to do, but may not make sense the first time you see it.
